> Alter how each item appears, including name, material, lore, and the slot. We believe that each server should have full-access to customize our plugins to best fit their server.

**Collection Access Permissions**
> Restrict players from accessing any collection by setting the access permission.

**Run Commands On Collection Completion**
> Give your players any reward whenever they complete a collection.

**Create Unlimited Collections and Tasks**
> Specify any collections, or tasks for any collection, and we'll generate unlimited pages for them to be displayed on.
